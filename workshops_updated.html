            <p>
              Are you a researcher looking to harness the full potential 
              of data analysis and visualization for your work? Join our 
              exclusive workshop on the "Essentials of R for Researchers" 
              and embark on a journey to become an R programming expert. 
              The Center for Data Science is to disseminate knowledge in 
              Data Science and Statistics among researchers, academics and 
              industry personnel. The center has been conducting workshops 
              for local and foreign students for more than six years now. 
              It has seen the necessity of educating and guiding young engineering
               students and researchers on conducting essential research methods 
               using statistical software, R.

            <p>
              Climate change and rapid urbanization with growing population 
              have prompted an emerging interest on construction industries to 
              include more sustainable practices. To accomplish a net-zero carbon 
              building stock in 2050, direct and indirect building CO2 release 
              needs to be assessed and quantified. Thus, the assessment of global 
              warming potential of buildings, through life cycle assessment, 
              taking into account both the processes and materials, to promote 
              the use of more sustainable construction materials and processes 
              is timely. Different techniques associated with sustainability 
              assessment of built environments will be discussed through lectures 
              and interactive activities.  An introduction to the life cycle 
              assessment of built environment will be given. 
              <br><br>
              Different life cycle assessment tools available to calculate the global warming 
              potential of built environment will be shown with examples. 
              Building-SAT, the locally developed whole building sustainability 
              tool will be introduced (<a href="http://building-sat.com/">http://building-sat.com/</a>). 
              Also the methodology for estimate the operational energy using a 
              energy modelling software will be shared as a hands on session. 
              Finally, there will be a hands-on session to use Building-SAT tool 
              to assess the Global Warming Potential of a simple building. 
              Further a discussion of case studies and real-world examples of 
              successful LCA implementation in the building sector will be presented.

            <h3 class="margin-20">Workshop 3 - Sequencing Success: A Hands-On Workshop in Deep Learning for Sequence-to-Sequence Models</h3>
            <p>
              This hands-on workshop focused on sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) 
              learning, a popular deep learning technique used for various natural 
              language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, speech 
              recognition, etc. The workshop aims to provide participants with a 
              comprehensive understanding of Seq2Seq models and equip them with 
              the necessary skills to implement and train their own models. 
              The workshop will cover theoretical and practical aspects of 
              Seq2Seq learning, enabling participants to apply this powerful 
              technique to real-world NLP problems.
              <br><br>
              The workshop will provide participants with hands-on experience 
              through interactive coding sessions in google collab cloud services. 
              So the participants only need to bring laptops with access to the internet.

            <p>
              MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, entails an 
              organizational transformation that leverages the synergy 
              between individuals, processes, and technology to ensure 
              the efficient delivery of machine learning solutions. It 
              emphasizes the need for robustness, scalability, reliability, 
              and automation throughout the entire machine-learning lifecycle.
              <br><br>
              During this workshop, we will guide you through contemporary 
              engineering techniques and industry best practices for scaling 
              up and operationalizing machine learning models in enterprise 
              and business-critical environments. In this workshop, we will 
              be focusing on both theoretical principles and practical 
              implementation, encompassing vital aspects such as model 
              reproducibility, validation, deployment, and monitoring.
