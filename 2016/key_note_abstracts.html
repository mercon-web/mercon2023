					<p><strong>Title</strong>: Regaining Sri Lanka Through Science and Technology Innovation - Engineering Research and the J-SLIP Initiative</p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Regaining Sri Lanka implies mobilizing our strengths as a diverse nation of peoples with a rich cultural 
					heritage to face the future with creativity and optimism. The presentation views science and technology innovation (STI) as a neutral 
					platform that can bring our peoples together in shaping such a future. Engineering research is a key ingredient of this endeavour and
					MERCon 2016 offers us an opportunity to explore into and initiate this transformation. This presentation is structured into three 
					parts, viz. (1) The transdisciplinary context of future engineering research and STI; (2) The prospects offered by the J-SLIP 
					initiative for balanced regional development; and (3) The design and execution of two propulsive projects related to human health 
					and well-being.</p>
					<p>The first part outlines the transdisciplinary context in which this new era for engineering research and STI in Sri Lanka has
					to be fostered. Sri Lanka’s transition to good governance (‘yahapalanaya’) has to overcome some formidable political hurdles but
					this burden will be eased considerably if it takes against a background of balanced spatial development and sustainable economic
					growth. It is noteworthy that the government has committed itself to steer this growth in keeping with the 17 sustainable development
					goals (SDGs). Legislation to facilitate this in developing the five development regions delineated in the government’s 60-month 
					programme is currently being initiated, possibly the first country in the world to make such an explicit commitment to the SDGs.
					The Sri Lankan President’s presentation to the G7 summit members in May this year, where Japan as Chair has suggested taking up 
					Sri Lanka’s development challenges in a special session, is likely to discuss the progress of this 60-month programme in the context
					of the SDGs and quality infrastructure development.</p>
					<p>The second part looks at STI in the context of balanced regional development. Recognizing that if left unaddressed regions 
					where STI talent gravitates to, conventionally the large metropolitan regions, will link up quickly with the global value chain
					and draw away from the rest of the nation’s hinterland regions, which could rapidly depopulate and lose economic impetus. 
					Articulating a circulatory relationship between Technology Driver regions and Technology Test Bed regions, this section proposes
					a solution to the issue of spatial disparities in well being in the national landscape. STI-driven engineering research, if 
					coupled with global partnerships of excellence, can hasten Sri Lanka’s entry into the global value chain. Towards this end, 
					this section will outline the ideas underlying the Japan-Sri Lanka Innovation Platform (J-SLIP), born out of the recent 
					Declaration of Joint Comprehensive Partnership between the Prime Ministers of Japan and Sri Lanka in October 2015. Plans are 
					under way for presenting the projects incubated under the J-SLIP initiative at a forum of scientists, both domestic and 
					international, from 8-10 September this year. At this Forum, the Science and Technology for Society (STS) Forum in Sri Lanka (2016),
					organized by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, the prospects for engineering research to power Sri Lanka’s development
					towards an advanced economy will be the focus of much discussion.</p>
					<p>Against the above background of Sri Lanka’s national development and the J-SLIP initiative, two propulsive projects from 
					the speaker’s laboratories will be discussed from the perspective of: (a) Inspiration and the timeline of evolution; (b) the 
					underlying science and trans-disciplinary project design; and (c) anticipated outcomes and their societal and environmental 
					impacts. The first project is in the emerging field of agro-photonics. It originated with an STI-driven search for agricultural
					adaptation to climate change but has since evolved into what could well become an important preventive health initiative. 
					The second project aims at alleviating hardships associated with debilitating disease. Stroke treatment in the acute care phase
					is the focus of this project, which has tremendous implications for downstream treatment and patient outcomes. Both these projects
					involve the marriage of engineering and medical research in driving the STI. Of particular relevance to this conference is how both
					projects navigate between fundamental and applied research, involve partnerships between advanced and emerging/developing economies,
					using the concept of ‘creative utilitarianism’, an imperative for driving innovative research in developing and emerging economies.
					The modalities common to both projects, although they are from widely different subject areas, will be discussed with a view towards
					replicability and up-scaling as well as implementation in a local, customized context. Such propulsive projects, address several 
					SDGs simultaneously.</p>
					<p>The presentation concludes by emphasizing why technologically advanced economies, like Japan, need to partner with developing
					and emerging economies. The above projects indicate how this might be done under the umbrella of an STI platform like J-SLIP.</p>

					<h4>Prof. Saman K. Halgamuge</h4>
					<p>Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Melbourne.</p>
					<p><strong>Title</strong>: Data Engineering Meets Health</p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Data Engineering promotes an engineering approach to anlyse big “imperfect” data by creating and
					using new smart algorithms such as Unsupervised Deep Learning, appropriate electronic hardware platforms and 
					mechanical/mechatronic/material/chemical-based approaches to interrogate and acquire missing data or information. 
					The talk will focus on this paradigm and provide example algorithms and applications from the health sector, for example, 
					neural engineering research on epilepsy and other brain deceases, biomechanical approaches and bioinformatics approaches 
					attempting to find solutions to hard problems in cancer genomics, plat metabolomics, virus detection and drug characterization
					introducing about 10 on-going PhD projects.  Other applications of data engineering, for example, operational optimization of 
					smart grids and business analytics will also be briefly presented. At the conclusion of the talk information about the 
					UGC-University of Melbourne Elite PhD program will also be provided.</p>

					<p><strong>Title</strong>: Engineering Radio Waves for Future Wireless Communication and Biomedical Systems</p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Radio-frequency waves, including microwaves, play a crucial role in current wireless systems, both 
					communication and biomedical. Millimetre-waves are being seriously considered for the next-generation (5G and beyond) communication 
					systems because the expected improvement in throughput cannot be achieved only from improvement to coding and other “soft” techniques
					and a significant improvement in the physical layer enhancement (i.e. hardware) is required. Wi-Fi is reaching its limit in 2.5 GHz
					band and faster millimetre-wave systems such as Wi-Gig will become common in households. Recent discoveries and advances in photonic
					crystals, electromagnetic band gap, metamaterials and metasurfaces have inspired researchers to consider periodic structures when 
					engineering wave propagation and radiation. This keynote speech will outline selected recent developments in these areas of research.
					It indicates how bulky dish antennas in communication systems may be replaced by aesthetically appealing flat high-gain antennas, 
					how flexible wearable antennas and implantable antennas can provide comprehensive health monitoring in real-time and how steerable 
					beams can provide a better quality of service in future wireless networks in homes and offices, including millimetre-wave networks.  </p>

					<p><strong>Title</strong>: Dynamic Network Security- Intrusion Detection and Response</p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Use of internet based application in modern society is growing
						exponentially. Rapid development of service automation, social networking and connected devices continues to expand the human
						activities in cyber space resulting in vast quantities of security-critical data being accessible over internet. This has in turn
						caused an explosion of illegal activities such as unauthorized data access, data theft, data modification, fraud and various other
						intrusion activities. To mitigate such risks, intrusion detection and response techniques are becoming increasingly critical. 
						We will explore the state of the art in advanced intrusion detection as well as intrusion response processes that aim to provide
						real time protection to current computer systems and networks.</p>
