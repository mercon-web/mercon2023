			<h2>Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christoph Bayer</h2>
			<h4>Department of Process Engineering<br>
				Technical University of Applied Sciences Nürnberg</h4>
			<h3>A Glimpse at Process Design and Information Systems</h3>
			<p>For an extended period of time, the process industries have been relying heavily on modeling and simulation to improve their plant designs.
			Commercial as well as proprietary software tools are used for the validation of design models against plant data (pilot plant, full-scale 
			reference plant, etc.), its adaptation to site specifications and its economic optimization. Economics generally improve further as such 
			plants are deeply integrated with site infrastructure and other production plants.</p>
			<p>Currently, trends and new developments such as deep learning, system digitalization, integrated engineering tools and smart plants resonate
			strongly within industry. These developments could significantly alter existing process design methodologies, since greater complexities in 
			design, construction and operation become manageable. In this context, this presentation aims at giving an overview about the state of methods,
			the tools in use and the path forward.</p>

			<h3>Power Outages and Large-Scale Renewable Energy Penetration</h3>
			<p>Electric power transmission systems spread across large geographic areas present significant challenges to the engineers. 
			Operating the system stably while maintaining voltage and frequency variations within narrow tolerance margins require careful 
			long term planning as well as short term operational planning.</p>
			<p>These planning efforts of utility engineers are supported by significant research and development efforts of various 
			international organizations. As a result of these planning efforts power system outages that impact widespread regions
			are very rare. Over the years, power system community has acquired significant experience related to the operation of 
			traditional power systems where the generation is predominantly based on synchronous generators. However, the large scale 
			penetration of renewable energy is expected to present new challenges. The renewably energy generation is interfaced to 
			the transmission system with the use of power electronic converters. The dynamic response characteristics of power electronic 
			based generation are much different from conventional generators. Specifically, the converter based generators do not 
			contribute to the system inertia and thus can potentially make the power system vulnerable following system events such and line faults.</p>
			<p>Power outages that effect large geographic regions are rare. In most reported cases of blackouts, the event was triggered 
			by an improbable contingency. The keynote will present number of blackout events including a Sri Lankan example. Special 
			protection or remedial action schemes that are typically used to help maintain system stability in the event of extreme contingencies 
			will be outlined during the presentation. The key characteristics of renewable energy generators that can impact system 
			stability will be presented.</p>

			<h2>Dr. Susumu Sugiyama</h2>
			<h4>Ritsumeikan University, Japan</h4>
			<h3>Environmental Friendly Polymer MEMS Technology</h3>
			<p>A sustainable and environmental friendly polymer MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) fabrication technology has been 
			developed using thermal imprinting and polishing process. MEMS structures with minimum size of 2μm and maximum aspect ratio 
			of 15 were formed by the polymer MEMS fabrication technology. In this paper, PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate) which has several 
			advantages such as lower fabrication cost, more flexible, softer, transparency and biocompatible, etc., was used for MEMS 
			actuators and a sensor utilizing small Young’s modulus and large thermal expansion coefficient. As the demonstration of the 
			proposed polymer MEMS fabrication technology, comb drive electrostatic micro actuators, electrothermal micro actuators and a 
			capacitive micro accelerometer were fabricated and characterized. For the reliability evaluation of the polymer MEMS, the 
			fatigue testing of micro-sized PMMA structures have been carried out. It was able to obtain a fatigue life 1.0×107 cycles 
			under 92MPa bending stress. The proposal polymer MEMS process has been confirmed it is promising as a sustainable MEMS 
			production technology.</p>

			<h4>United Nations University, Japan and 
				<br>Team Leader, Centre for Flood Control and Water Management
				<br>Metro Colombo Urban Development Project, Ministry of  Megapolis and Western Development
			</h4>
			<h3>Urban Water Management in Metro Colombo</h3>
			<p>Flooding in Colombo and environs has for many years been hampering public life and obstructing traffic and commercial 
			activities on a regular basis. The flooding has three major causes: a) lack of outfall capacity, b) lack of storage capacity,
			and c) bottlenecks in the river and canal system (bridges, culverts, narrow river bends, blocking bridge piers/abutments,
			pipeline crossings, etc.).</p>
			<p>In 2012 the World Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) agreed upon a loan for a Metro Colombo Urban Development 
			Project (MCUDP). The overall Project Development Objective of the Loan is to support the GoSL in:
				<ol>
					<li>reducing flooding in the catchment of the Colombo Water Basin, and</li>
					<li>strengthening the capacity of local authorities in the Colombo Metropolitan area to rehabilitate, improve 
					and maintain local infrastructure and services through selected demonstration investments.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>The project consists of three components:
			<ol>
				<li>Flood and Drainage Management.</li>
				<li>Urban Development, Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Capac- ity Building for Metro Colombo local authorities.</li>
				<li>Implementation Support.</li>
			</ol>
			Under the Loan a number of projects will be implemented in the fields of urban drainage and flood management/mitigation. 
			This component has been split into two parts, one primarily aiming at the macro-drainage system, including the greater 
			Colombo catchment/basin, and one aiming at the micro-drainage system, which primarily covers the metropolitan area. 
			Measures include new diversions (canals or tunnels), widening of river/canal stretches, river-bend widening, 
			smoothening or bend cut-offs, enlarging existing outfalls, construction of new gate structures, upgrading 
			street drains, enlarging culverts, etc.</p>
			<p>In addition, apart from structural measures a number of non-structural measures are being considered to strengthen 
			the flood management capacity, such as a Real-Time Control (RTC) System, and/or a Flood Early Warning System (FEWS). 
			In 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka announced an ambitious plan to develop the Western Province to a large Megalopolis, 
			and a new ministry, the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (MMWD) was established to implement the programme. 
			Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development corporation that implement the Metro Colombo Development Project also comes 
			under MMWD. For the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development assessing short term and long-term flood risks is 
			important to safeguard its investment and ensure sustainable urban development.</p>
			<p>Thus it was decided to enhance the scope of the proposed RTC to incorporate also current and future risk assessment.
			A new facility to handle Flood Control and Water Management is currently being setup that will: 
			<ol>
				<li>Develop an integrated flood control and water management in- formation system</li>
				<li>Provide early warning support for the Metro colombo area</li>
				<li>Develop optimal operational rules for the flood control facilities such as pumps and storage facilities 
				considering also the potential storage and use water to make a pleasant urban environment.</li>
				<li>Assess current and evolving future risk to Megapolis from urban development as well as climate change.</li>
			</ol>
