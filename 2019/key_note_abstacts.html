			<h3>Renewable Energy and the Role of Hydrogen as a Future Fuel for Clean Cities</h3>
			<p>
        Due to world population growth, growing industrial development, improvements in living
        standards, emerging technologies (such as electric vehicles) and the growth in the domestic and
        industrial use of modern equipment, the current growing trend in electricity demand and
        consumption will continue long into the future. The management of electrical energy supply to
        meet the growing demand without contributing more to the greenhouse gas problem is a major
        task. To reduce greenhouse gases, more and more renewable sources of electrical energy are
        being added to networks. However, these new sources of supplies can be intermittent and
        variable. Wind, for example, is a valuable source of green energy but its availability is very
        variable. Solar energy is available during the daytime subjected to sunshine but it is not available
        during the night. Usually, the peak demand of electricity for industrial customers is during the
        daytime and the peak demand for domestic customers is during early evenings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growth and sustainability of future renewable energies, therefore, requires the management of
        electricity networks using smart grid technologies. It also requires options to store energy and
        regenerate during demand periods. On a small scale, options are required to have self-contained
        integrated systems to store energy. Hydrogen in this context is considered to be the clean fuel of
        the future which does not contribute to greenhouse gases. Moreover, hydrogen has been
        recognised as a possible energy storage medium. Excess electricity from wind and solar could be
        converted to hydrogen by electrolysis. Depending on the application, hydrogen could be stored
        using various techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lecture, the role of hydrogen in the context of renewable energy is explained and the
        methods of hydrogen storage options are discussed. Properties of hydrogen as a fuel are further
        explained, as are its advantages and disadvantages. Research undertaken into hydrogen storage
        systems, combustion and safety aspects of hydrogen are further highlighted.

			<h3>Autonomous Vehicles - The Outlook</h3>
      <p>
        The expectation of the imminent arrival of the autonomous vehicles into our lives has led to
        raging debates around the world about their ethical and technological aspects. The opinions about
        what it is, is widely varied. At the same time the researchers and the developers ranging from
        academia to major car manufacturers are fast advancing towards the introduction of some form of
        autonomous vehicle into the market. As such, now is a good time to discuss, the possible
        scenarios of future autonomous vehicles. The presenter will present the autonomous field vehicles
        his team has developed over the years for the agricultural, mining and road construction sector
        and then will shed some light on the possibilities for the public transport sector. Finally, he will
        present some challenges to the audience to stimulate their thinking to understand the outlook for
        the autonomous vehicles on our roads.

			<h4>University of Oulu, Finland</h4>
			<h3>Wireless Communications â€“ 5G to 6G</h3>
      <p>
        We are now in the first stage of ushering in 5G communication systems. While the initial focus
        will be broadband services named as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), other more industry
        driven applications are also gaining ground. Main among those is the use of ultra-reliable low
        latency communications (URLLC) targeting applications such as Industrial Internet-of-Things
        (IoT) and eHealth. It is also expected that a large number of devices will be connected to the
        wireless networks which necessitate innovative methods of granting access and being energy
        efficient. The current standardization addresses these to a certain extent with frequency
        allocations in sub 6 GHz and going into mmWave region starting from 28 GHz and above.
        Going into mmWave though brings more bandwidth, also results in several challenges due to
        narrow beam widths and a large number of antenna elements to be used. Given the variety of
        applications anticipated such as VR, AR, MR which are now known as XR technologies we need
        to think about moving capabilities from central cloud towards the edge of the network. The
        change from a heavily structured architecture to a distributed one with novel uses of artificial
        intelligence, while not a silver bullet, and machine learning methods need to be further
        investigated. These include all layers from the PHY layer and above. There is another change
        that may need considerable discussion in regulatory bodies, which is the role of operators and
        spectrum allocation. Given that more services will be needed locally with low latency and high
        capacity and short coverage distances of mmWave systems, it is possible that it may be logical to
        have local operators covering certain premises rather than the macro level larger area. This talk
        will discuss these issues, current scenario in standardization and research leading into 6G.
