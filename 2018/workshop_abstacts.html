			<h2>Hack your Thoughts: Key Aspects of Brain-Computer-Interfacing</h2>
			<h3>by Prof. Kazuo Kiguchi, Kyushu University, Japan; Dr. Anjula De Silva, Dr. Thilina Lelarathne, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h3>
			<h4>May 31, 2018</h4>
			<h4>9:00am - 4:00pm</h4>
			<h4>ENTC1, Dept. of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering</h4>
			<p>Thoughts are essentially the initial trigger of motor activation and the point of perception for sensory stimulation. Therefore, the understanding of the generating mechanism of specific thoughts is valuable to trigger motor actions and to assess the state of mind resulting from sensory stimulation. These so called ‘thoughts’ are high level states of the brain which are reflected by activity of cortical neurons. Due to close proximity, electroencephalogram (EEG) from the scalp is a convenient method of measuring such states of the brain. Accurate identification of these thoughts has prompted to use this technology in enhancing movements such as in assistive technologies, bridging communication gaps that exist in people with special needs and assessing the brain state (fatigue/relax) while attending to long duration critical tasks and providing real-time feedback of the brain while immersed in virtual reality (VR) environments.</p>
			<p>This workshop intends to broaden the view of attendees by discussing the neurological process behind the thought generation process, hardware required for EEG recordings, digital signal conditioning, thought classification and how they can be used in application such as assistive technology and VR. Apart from discussions, the organises intend to include a hands-on session on hacking thoughts through well-established EEG paradigms exposing the attendee to the end-to-end process of hacking thoughts through EEG.</p>

			<h2>Process Control and Real-Time Optimization</h2>
			<h3>Dr. Seyed Soheil Mansouri and Dr. Isuru S.B.A. Udugama, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby</h3>
			<h4>June 1, 2018</h4>
			<h4>9:00am - 12:00pm</h4>
			<h4>Department of Chemical and Process Engineering</h4>
			<p>The tools and concepts developed in the areas of process control and process optimisation has relevance and applicability in all process industries ranging from petrochemicals to biotechnology based production. Process control and real time optimization has the potential to increase plant capacity, reduce energy consumption and increase plant reliability at very low capital costs. The main reason for this low capital costs is because these tools purely work by better managing the unit operations and does not require the installation of additional equipment. In this workshop, we will cover the area of process control and real time optimization from both an industrial and theoretical point of view, and discuss both established and state of the art ideas. We will also discuss implications of applying Process Systems Engineering (PSE) methods and tools together with real world examples and case studies from petrochemical production and industrial bio-based production. While we will look into a couple of case studies across different process industries, we also encourage you to bring your industrial cases studies to discuss. The intended audience for this workshop is both industry and academia.</p>

			<p>Deep learning allows computational models to learn and represent data with hierarchy of abstraction by implicitly
			capturing intricate structures of large‐scale data in terms of general features. Deep learning methods encompass
			neural networks, hierarchical probabilistic models, and many unsupervised and supervised feature learning
			algorithms. Recently deep learning methods have been shown to outperform in several tasks, such as object detection,
			speech processing, handwriting synthesis, etc.</p>

			<h2>Photovoltaic Power Conversion Systems: Current Trends</h2>
			<h3>Dr. Dulika Nayanasiri, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h3>
			<h4>June 1, 2018</h4>
			<h4>1:30pm - 4:30pm</h4>
			<h4>Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering</h4>
			<p>Photovoltaic (PV) power conversion systems gain attraction due to low energy pay-back time and low carbon foot print compared to other renewable energy technologies such as wind. Centralized and distributed power conversion systems are used to convert solar energy into electrical energy. Distributed PV power conversion systems are frequently used in small and medium scale applications. Module and sub module level power converters are used in distributed systems such as roof-top PV. However, intermittent nature and seasonal behavior of the solar energy limits the applications of PV as a continuous power source. Energy storing element can be integrated to the system to circumvent this drawback. Application specific energy storing methods improve power processing capability of the system. Such an integration can be done using DC systems due to in-born characteristics of renewable generators and energy storing elements. This gives rise to concept of micro and nano-grids based on DC. DC nano-grids with integrated communication capabilities improve user experience with respect to the concept of zero net energy home. Power electronic converters and communication protocols having energy transfer capability play a significant role in the realization of such a system.</p>
			<p>In this workshop, we are going to talk about existing PV power conversion systems architectures and converter topologies to identify limitations of the state of the art technologies. The proposed system architectures such as networked DC nano-grids to circumvent those limitations will be discussed emphasizing current trends.</p>

			<h2>Waste Water Treatment Fundamentals, Plant Monitoring, and Operations</h2>
			<h3>Dr. P.G. Rathnasiri, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka</h3>
			<h4>June 1, 2018</h4>
			<h4>9:00am - 12:00pm</h4>
			<h4>Conference Room, Department of Chemical Engineering</h4>
			<p>Workshop introduces fundamentals of waste water treatment, operation and monitoring. Discussion begins with 
			characterization of wastewater/solid waste and different techniques available. Then biological wastewater 
			treatment will be classified with the objective of understanding aerobic, anaerobic, suspended, attached growth
			processes and will be presented with established industrial wastewater treatment plants. Overview of organic
			carbon, bio Phosphorous and nitrogen removal will be presented. Successful design and operation of any 
			wastewater/solid waste treatment plant require knowledge on microorganisms involved, specific reactions they
			perform, nutritional needs and more importantly environmental and operating parameters which affect for their 
			better performance. Different unit operations belong to primary, secondary and tertiary treatment and their 
			performance will be also discussed. Reactor types used in typical aerobic and anaerobic processes will be 
			presented with the objective of guiding environmental engineer for screening different options. Significance 
			of applying simulations for analysis of wastewater treatment plant will be presented with AQUASIM 2.1f dynamic 
			simulator.</p>
